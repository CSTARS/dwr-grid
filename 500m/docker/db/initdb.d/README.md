# Data Initialization

Here are a number of SQL files that are used to initialize the database.  Most
of the files here are maintained with emacs org-mode files, and then untangled
into the sql.  This is the best way (IMO) to allow both documented SQL steps,
inactive components, and good initialization.  The are executed in sort order.
